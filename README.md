# Linux-Shell-Bash-Scripts

To run the file, type the command `chmod +x findEmployees.sh` on your linux terminal.
Above command will give execute permissions for the **findEmployees.sh** file.

*Make sure that you save the **employees.txt** file and the **findEmployees.sh** file in the same folder.*

After giving execute permissions to the file, then type the command `./findEmployees.sh employees.txt IT`
*The above command will then run the script with two input parameters, where **employees.txt** is the input file to be search for; and **IT** is the department name to be search for.*
Syntax for the same is : `./script.sh filename.txt department_name`

The script will then print the output on the terminal.
The output will be the details of all employees who work in the IT department.
